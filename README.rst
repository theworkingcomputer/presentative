It's not Facebook!
******************

Presentative is
===============

a highly curated/moderated group-blog web application for friends to post substantive content for their peers and associates to see and critique, without resorting to the sort of vicious stupidity and ad hominem attacks that characterize so much of the internet. It is intentionally not designed to be a site for casual interactions, but is, instead, a place to describe things about which one cares deeply or in which one has invested substantial time and effort.
